# Hey 👋,
I am a 21 yo fresh grad who just recently stepped into the corporate world to learn from a different perspective! I am a Junior Software Engineer at Bowens (Web Development Team) and I am interested in writing and developing software and web development using JavaScript, Vuejs, ReactJs, Java and Python. 🚀

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own personal portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning three.js, solidity & vanilla script.
